# hackathon
Hackathon organized at IMD/UFRN in Natal.

This site contains some resources used for the Hackathon:
- models used for the traffic lights controller
- pdfs of the slides presented

Required tools are:
- [ProB](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=Installation) (zip + third-party installers)
- [Atelier CSSP IDE](https://clearsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CSSP_for_education_20230522.zip) (zip)

By default, use:
- [Atelier B](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/atelier-b-support-maintenance/download-atelier-b/)  (installer)

Unfortunately the Atelier B CSSP IDE is not working properly on the Lab303 machines, event if everything is stored on a USB key. So during the hackathon, the CSSP IDE is going to be used only for the modelling of the CLEARSY Safety Platform activities without the simulation capability (sorry).
